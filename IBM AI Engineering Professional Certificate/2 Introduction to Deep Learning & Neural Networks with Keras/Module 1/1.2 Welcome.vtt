00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
Hello everyone! And welcome to the deep

2
00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.430
learning fundamentals with Keras course.

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.710
I am Alex Aklson, your course

4
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.559
instructor. In this introductory course, I

5
00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.349
will try to teach you the basics of one

6
00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.269
of the hottest topics in the field of

7
00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.930
data science, which is deep learning. This

8
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.490
course will consist of four modules,

9
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.890
which you should be able to complete in

10
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.849
four weeks. In module 1, I will try to

11
00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.310
motivate you about this field. I know

12
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.500
that the fact that you are here, you must

13
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.630
be already motivated to learn about deep

14
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.910
learning, but I will share with you some

15
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.250
very exciting applications of deep

16
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.350
learning that will hopefully motivate

17
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.989
you even more, and demonstrate to you

18
00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.940
that there is almost no limit to what

19
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.550
can be done using deep learning. We will

20
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.829
also briefly cover neurons and neural

21
00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.780
networks in the brain, so you can

22
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.449
appreciate how they inspire artificial

23
00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.969
neural networks. Then, we will start

24
00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.010
learning about the different topics

25
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.719
associated with artificial neural

26
00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.210
networks, and in this module we will

27
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.069
focus on the process of forward

28
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:10.530
propagation. In module 2, we will continue

29
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.060
learning about artificial neural

30
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.030
networks, and focus on how an artificial

31
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.659
neural network learns, what is gradient

32
00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.360
descent, and what are activation

33
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.729
functions. In module 3, we will learn

34
00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.590
about some of the most popular deep

35
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.799
learning libraries, namely Keras, PyTorch,

36
00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.100
and TensorFlow. And we will learn

37
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.320
how to use the Keras library to build

38
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.049
models for regression and classification

39
00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.250
problems. In module 4, we will learn about

40
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.860
supervised and unsupervised deep neural

41
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.020
networks, namely convolutional neural

42
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.040
networks, recurrent neural networks. and

43
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.170
autoencoders. We will also learn how to

44
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.420
use the Keras library to build a

45
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.120
convolutional neural network.

46
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.200
Before I conclude this video,

47
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.299
I would like to make an important note.

48
00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.780
In this course, I decided to focus on the

49
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.280
fundamentals of deep learning. Deep

50
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.319
learning is a vast

51
00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.299
field now and is continuously evolving

52
00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.599
at a fast pace. Therefore, the field can

53
00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.719
be intimidating to many people, so I have

54
00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.730
tailored this course to those who really

55
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.709
know nothing about deep learning or

56
00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.590
neural networks. If you have worked a lot

57
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.840
with artificial neural networks and deep

58
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.969
learning models, then maybe this course

59
00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.040
is not for you. You are more than welcome

60
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.870
to still take it as a refresher,

61
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.629
but maybe you will not learn a lot. While I

62
00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.519
will introduce you to some advanced

63
00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.739
topics in deep learning, but I am just

64
00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.480
going to give you a simplified version

65
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.940
of them. I just wanted to

66
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.580
make this point clear in order to set

67
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.180
the expectations right at the beginning

68
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.200
of the course. And now with that, welcome

69
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.320
again and let's get started!
