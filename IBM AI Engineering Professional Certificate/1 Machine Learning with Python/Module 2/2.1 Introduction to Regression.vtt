Hello and welcome! In this video we'll be
giving a brief introduction to regression. So

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.690
let's get started. Look at this data set. It's
related to co2 emissions from different cars.

3
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.950
It includes engine size, number of cylinders,
fuel consumption, and co2 emission from various

4
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:27.570
automobile models. The question is: given this
data set can we predict the co2 emission of a

5
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.160
car using other fields such as engine size or
cylinders? Let's assume we have some historical

6
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.340
data from different cars and assume that a car
such as in row 9 has not been manufactured yet,

7
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.660
but we're interested in estimating its approximate
co2 emission after production. Is it possible?

8
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.070
We can use regression methods to predict a
continuous value such as co2 emission using

9
00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.210
some other variables. Indeed regression is the
process of predicting a continuous value. In

10
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.290
regression there are two types of variables: a
dependent variable and one or more independent

11
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.300
variables. The dependent variable can be seen as
the state, target, or final goal we study and try

12
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.320
to predict. And the independent variables, also
known as explanatory variables, can be seen as the

13
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.670
causes of those states. The independent variables
are shown conventionally by X and the dependent

14
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.860
variable is notated by Y. A regression model
relates Y or the dependent variable to a function

15
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:48.420
of X i.e. the independent variables. The key point
in the regression is that our dependent value

16
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.800
should be continuous and cannot be a discrete
value. However, the independent variable, or

17
00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:05.040
variables, can be measured on either a categorical
or continuous measurement scale. So, what we want

18
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.000
to do here is to use the historical data of some
cars using one or more of their features and from

19
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.250
that data make a model. We use regression to build
such a regression estimation model; then the model

20
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:27.930
is used to predict the expected co2 emission
for a new or unknown car. Basically there are

21
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:35.070
two types of regression models simple regression
and multiple regression. Simple regression is when

22
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.430
one independent variable is used to estimate a
dependent variable. It can be either linear or

23
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.770
non-linear. For example, predicting co2 emission
using the variable of engine size. Linearity of

24
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.880
regression is based on the nature of relationship
between independent and dependent variables. When

25
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:03.510
more than one independent variable is present the
process is called multiple linear regression. For

26
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.320
example, predicting co2 emission using engine
size and the number of cylinders in any given

27
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.430
car. Again, depending on the relation between
dependent and independent variables it can be

28
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:24.270
either linear or non-linear regression. Let's
examine some sample applications of regression.

29
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:31.560
Essentially we use regression when we want
to estimate a continuous value. For instance,

30
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.340
one of the applications of regression analysis
could be in the area of sales forecasting. You

31
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.160
can try to predict a sales person's total yearly
sales from independent variables such as age,

32
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.910
education, and years of experience. It can also
be used in the field of psychology, for example,

33
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:58.290
to determine individual satisfaction, based on
demographic and psychological factors. We can

34
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:04.260
use regression analysis to predict the price of
a house in an area, based on its size number of

35
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.790
bedrooms, and so on. We can even use it to predict
employment income for independent variables such

36
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:20.790
as hours of work, education, occupation, sex,
age, years of experience, and so on. Indeed,

37
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.120
you can find many examples of the usefulness of
regression analysis in these and many other fields

38
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:34.920
or domains, such as finance, healthcare, retail,
and more. We have many regression algorithms,

39
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.500
each of them has its own importance and a
specific condition to which their application

40
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.200
is best suited. And while we've covered just a
few of them in this course, it gives you enough

41
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.480
base knowledge for you to explore different
regression techniques. Thanks for watching.
