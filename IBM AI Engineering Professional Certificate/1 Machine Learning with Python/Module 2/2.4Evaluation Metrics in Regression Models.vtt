00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.735
In this video,

3
00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:07.565
we'll be covering accuracy
metrics for model evaluation.

4
00:00:07.565 --> 00:00:09.455
So let's get started.

5
00:00:09.455 --> 00:00:12.090
Evaluation metrics are used

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.535
to explain the
performance of a model.

7
00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:15.960
Let's talk more about

8
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.550
the model evaluation metrics

9
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.335
that are used for regression.

10
00:00:19.335 --> 00:00:22.530
As mentioned, basically,
we can compare

11
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.109
the actual values and predicted

12
00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.905
values to calculate the accuracy
of our regression model.

13
00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:30.765
Evaluation metrics

14
00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:33.030
provide a key role in
the development of

15
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.310
a model as it provides insight

16
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.035
to areas that
require improvement.

17
00:00:38.035 --> 00:00:41.540
We'll be reviewing a number
of model evaluation metrics,

18
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.620
including Mean Absolute
Error, Mean Squared Error,

19
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.205
and Root Mean Squared Error,

20
00:00:48.205 --> 00:00:51.170
but before we get
into defining these,

21
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.610
we need to define what
an error actually is.

22
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.005
In the context of regression,

23
00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:59.870
the error of the model is
the difference between

24
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.160
the data points and

25
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.890
the trend line generated
by the algorithm.

26
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.320
Since there are
multiple data points,

27
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.740
an error can be determined
in multiple ways.

28
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.575
Mean Absolute Error is the mean

29
00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:15.365
of the absolute
value of the errors.

30
00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:18.545
This is the easiest of the
metrics to understand,

31
00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.945
since it's just
the average error.

32
00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:25.385
Mean Squared Error is the
mean of the squared error.

33
00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.760
It's more popular than Mean
Absolute Error because

34
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.705
the focus is geared more
towards large errors.

35
00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:34.955
This is due to the squared term,

36
00:01:34.955 --> 00:01:37.550
exponentially increasing
larger errors

37
00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.905
in comparison to smaller ones.

38
00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:42.590
Root Mean Squared Error is

39
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.800
the square root of the
mean squared error.

40
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.870
This is one of the
most popular of

41
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.000
the evaluation metrics because

42
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.360
Root Mean Squared Error
is interpretable in

43
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.395
the same units as the
response vector or Y units,

44
00:01:57.395 --> 00:02:00.800
making it easy to
relate its information.

45
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.230
Relative absolute error,

46
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.034
also known as residual
sum of square,

47
00:02:06.034 --> 00:02:09.700
where Y bar is a mean value of Y,

48
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.370
takes the total absolute
error and normalizes it.

49
00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.415
By dividing by the
total absolute error

50
00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:18.455
of the simple predictor.

51
00:02:18.455 --> 00:02:20.780
Relative squared error is very

52
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.360
similar to relative
absolute error,

53
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.070
but is widely adopted by

54
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.200
the data science community as it

55
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.950
is used for
calculating R-squared.

56
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.350
R-squared is not an
error per say but is

57
00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.730
a popular metric for the
accuracy of your model.

58
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.545
It represents how
close the data values

59
00:02:39.545 --> 00:02:42.530
are to the fitted
regression line.

60
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.660
The higher the R-squared,

61
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.365
the better the model
fits your data.

62
00:02:47.365 --> 00:02:49.580
Each of these metrics can be used

63
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.775
for quantifying of
your prediction.

64
00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:55.520
The choice of metric
completely depends on the type

65
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.450
of model your data type
and domain of knowledge.

66
00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.300
Unfortunately, further
review is out of

67
00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.450
scope of this course.
Thanks for watching.
